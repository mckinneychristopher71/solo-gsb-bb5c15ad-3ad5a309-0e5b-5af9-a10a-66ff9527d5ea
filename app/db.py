"""SQLite storage for immutable, versioned flag configurations.

Each published configuration is stored as a single JSON document keyed by a
client-provided version. Rows are never updated or deleted, so re-publishing a
new version cannot change the result of any evaluation pinned to an old
version.

Environments (``production``, ``staging``, ...) hold a *pointer* to one of the
immutable versions. The pointer carries a monotonically increasing
``revision`` used for optimistic concurrency control: a pointer may only be
created with ``expected_revision == 0`` and only be moved by a caller that
presents the revision it last observed. Every check and the write happen in a
single ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction, so a concurrent update loses the race
with ``409 stale_revision`` instead of silently overwriting the pointer.

Every successful pointer write also appends one row to ``environment_history``
inside the same transaction: environment name, the new revision, the target
version, the operation (``create``/``update``) and a timestamp. The row is
insert-only — nothing ever updates or deletes it — so the table is a
gap-free, immutable audit trail of how each pointer moved. Failed or stale
writes raise before the insert and roll back, leaving no record behind.
